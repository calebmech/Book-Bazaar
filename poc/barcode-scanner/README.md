# Proof of concept barcode Scanning

Using QuaggaJS library for scanning ISBN numbers from books. ISBN barcodes use the EAN-13 format which should be read by Quagga. 

The current status of this poc is failing to meet our expectations as far as scanning barcodes from the webcam. Currently I have only succeeded in scanning static images with no background noise.

# Other Barcode Scanning Libraries

dynamsoft - works well but is too expensive to license.

javascript-barcode-reader - worse than Quagga.
