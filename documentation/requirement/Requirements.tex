\section{Purpose}
The motivation for this project is to create an application that allows McMaster students to conveniently buy and sell textbooks in a secure marketplace. Currently, students use online websites like Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/macusedtexts) or the campus store’s buyback program \\ (https://campusstore.mcmaster.ca/information/guaranteed-buyback.html, suspended because of COVID) to sell their books. These current solutions are either disorganized or take a cut of the transaction. Book Bazar aims to create an organized marketplace that allows users to sell books for a better price than at the campus store.

The purpose of this System Requirements Specification (SRS) is to provide a clear overview of the project’s functional and non-functional requirements that are relevant to the application’s stakeholders.\\ % Comment about not needing non-functional requirements removed since TA said we need them
\newline
\small{ \textbf{NOTE:} Book Bazar's website where all the books to be sold are listed, is referred to as \textit{marketplace} in certain parts of this document.}
\section{Scope}
The scope for the project covers the following application features:
\be
	\item An authentication and authorization platform that verifies McMaster students and allows them to log into and use the application.
	\item A marketplace system that uses information from the campus store and allows users to:
		\bi
			\item Post about and categorize books that they would like to sell.
			\item Search for books that they would like to purchase.
		\ei
	\item A system that allows buyers and sellers to privately contact each other, agree on a price, and choose where they would like to meet.
	\item The application will be accessible from any device with a modern browser (phone, tablet, desktop, etc.) to provide the best experience.

\section{Context Diagram}
\label{sec:context}
% Ahmed: Can we change "University Library" to "Campus Bookstore"
% Ahmed: Is the arrow "Book Listings" from "Seller" to "Book System" the same content as "Book Listings" from "University Library" to "Book System". If they are not the same, I would recommend we change "Book Listings" for Seller and Buyers arrows to "Book Postings".
%SHOULD WE SHOW BOUNDARIES?

\section{Constants, Monitored and Controlled Variables}
%SHOULD WE REMOVE THIS?
% David: no we do need this per the discussion with Dr Wassyng. I think the only other thing that we might need to mention is that the OS and the browser handle keypresses and mouse interaction? I guess we also need to convert the price the seller inputs from a string into an IEEE-754 double precision floating point number
The Book Bazar application will not be using any elements from the physical world, like temperature, length, speed, etc., which require high precision when manipulating within the software. Elements from the physical world that Book Bazar will be using will be the Universal Product Code (UPC) code of books, information of users and the prices of books. All of these elements will be treated as constants and will not undergo changes.

%Help refining / sounding a bit more technical?

\section{Behaviour Overview}
\begin{comment}
This specification document specifies a software system that allows McMaster University students to buy and sell used textbooks. Students who have used textbooks that they want to sell can create a posting/listing on the system by entering the UPC/ISBN13 code of the book and adding their desired sell price. Students who are looking to buy books can view the listings that the sellers created. The buyers will be able to filter postings/listings in order to quickly find what they are looking for. When a buyer finds a posting for a textbook that they want, they will be able to send a message to the seller in order to confirm the price and schedule a time to meet up to sell/buy the textbook. A book seller will be able to remove their posting if they decide not to sell the textbook or manage to find a buyer some other way.

\hline
NFR4 & The $95^{\text{th}}$ percentile of a sample of page load times must be under 3 seconds & -\\

% David: This might be determined by the client that is loading the website,
% as well as the network speed.
% I think that we should provide a description of the computer and network that should be able to load
% the website within 3 seconds.
% Here is a rough idea of what I have in mind:
% 
\hline
NFR5 &Server must support 1000 concurrent users.& - \\ %is this achievable?
% David: I think that our budget directly determines how many concurrent users we can support.
% I believe we will be able to scale our website and backend (code that connects webpage and database) horizontally,
% which means we can rent more computers in order to increase the amount of users we support.
% Renting more computers costs more money, but could be cheaper then renting a faster computer to support more users.
% The more limiting factor might be our database,
% since from by understanding the only way to speed a relational database up is to run the database on a faster computer.
% Here is the pricing for Amazon RDS: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/pricing/?pg=pr&loc=3
\hline

NFR6 & A book must be listed to the website within 3 seconds of submission and visible to other users on the website.&- \\
% David: I think we should add something to the effect of: "and this change should be visible from other
% users on the website" just to be a bit more specific
%Harsh: Added.
\hline
NFR7& The application must have an availability rate of 99.9\% within any allocated time frame.&-\\
% David: Is this achievable? I think we should promise/aim for a little lower, and then hope to overachieve
\hline
% NFR7& If a user is signed up for notifications (email, phone, etc.), the application should push them out within 3 seconds.&-\\
% David: I think that 3 seconds might be a bit too low of a latency to achieve with SMS (texting), so I searched through the Twilio docs for their SLA on latency for text messaging but I didn't find any concrete numbers. I guess we can adjust in the future when we know better what to expect?
